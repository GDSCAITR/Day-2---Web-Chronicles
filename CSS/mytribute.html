        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made a number of remarkable contributions to the development of the country. He
            served not only as the Prime Minister of India but also as it Foreign Minister and Chairperson of various
            important Standing Committees of Parliament. He had also been an active Leader of the Opposition. Shri Atal
            Bihari Vajpayee has thus played a significant role in shaping up domestic and foreign policies of
            independent India. He was also a true advocate of social equality and an ardent champion of empowerment for
            women. Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee believed in an India that is anchored in 5000 years of civilisational
            history but as modernising, renewing and rejuvenating itself to meet the challenges that lay ahead in the
            years to come. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was mainly considered a pragmatist but when criticised for testing
            nuclear weapons in the year 1998, he assumed a non-deterring defiant posture. He also played a key role in
            making dedicated efforts to resolve the long running feud between Pakistan and India over the region of
            Kashmir. Given his inspiring leadership, India was able to achieve steady growth in the economy and soon
            paved the way for the nation to become a leader in the information technology sector.</p>
